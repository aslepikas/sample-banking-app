Sample banking app using Spring boot.

I did not manage to make the unit tests work - hence they are unfinished.
My idea was to test the schema as well. However, that did not pan out the way I wanted - 
none of the examples that I used for writing my own tests worked. Maybe it's because 
of the libraries used. I haven't figured that out yet.

In the end I should've used mocks for my @Repository objects when writing unit tests.
Alas, half a day was not enough to write the application with the unit tests. I feel it's 
not entirely fair to spend more time on an exercise such as this, hence I didn't ask for
any extensions. I guess it was a nice reality check nevertheless.
